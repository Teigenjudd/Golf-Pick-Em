# Poold — Product Roadmap

> **What this file is:** The prioritized plan — where we can win, what we build next,
> and how hard each thing is. Reference it at the start of every build session; update
> statuses as items ship and re-rank when strategy changes. What the product *is* today
> lives in `PRODUCT.md`; engineering-level defects live in `docs/BACKLOG.md` (IDs like
> A1/B2 below point there).
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-07-14 (P0.1 + P0.3 shipped — the security blockers are closed;
> P0.2 self-serve creation is now the whole critical path. See the status log.)
>
> **Ease scale:** 🟢 Easy (a session or two) · 🟡 Moderate (several sessions, one
> surface) · 🔴 Hard (multi-PR, schema + UI + new moving parts)
> **Impact:** judged against the three questions from PM.md — does it acquire
> commissioners, retain players, or cut friction?

## 1. Market snapshot (July 2026)

Researched: Splash Sports, RunYourPool, Majors Challenge, RunMyPools, EasyOfficePools.

- **Splash Sports** is the funded, real-money operator. Their golf lineup: tiered
  majors pools (six tiers, pick one per tier — *the same format we run*), One & Done
  (season-long, huge — $3,500-entry flagship with $1M+ guaranteed), Survivor, DFS.
  They handle entry collection and payouts — which is exactly why they carry state
  restrictions, KYC, and rake. They validate our format and can't follow us down the
  free/no-money path without breaking their business model.
- **RunYourPool** (multi-sport) and **Majors Challenge** (golf-first) both charge the
  commissioner ~$1 per entry. Both are feature-rich (message boards, multi-event
  season standings, custom scoring) and both look dated. Majors Challenge sells a
  $599/yr unlimited product to golf clubs and white-labels pools for brands — proof
  the club/course channel we're targeting has money in it.
- **RunMyPools / EasyOfficePools** are the free/cheap tail — templated, utilitarian.
- **Format landscape:** tier pools, One & Done, and majors-series (aggregate standings
  across the four majors) are the three formats that dominate golf pools. We have the
  first. We have nothing season-long — and season-long is what keeps a group alive
  between events.

**Conclusions — where Poold can win:**
1. **The friend-group experience.** Everyone else optimizes for pool *administration*;
   nobody owns the Saturday-afternoon *feeling*. Design, mobile feel, and social energy
   are our differentiation — lean in.
2. **Free + legal simplicity.** Incumbents charge the exact person we need to win
   (the commissioner); Splash carries regulatory weight everywhere. "Free, beautiful,
   no legal weirdness" is the pitch.
3. **Season-long play is the retention unlock.** A single-event pool dies Sunday
   night. A majors-season or One & Done pool keeps the group chat alive from April to
   July. This is the biggest format gap between us and every competitor.
4. **The club/bar channel is real** (Majors Challenge proves it) — but only after
   self-serve pool creation exists.

## 2. The blunt strategic read

Our stated strategy is "win the commissioner — they bring the group."
**Today, nobody but the founder can create a pool.** Pool creation is gated behind the
global admin role. Until that changes, Poold has no acquisition motion at all — every
other growth idea is downstream of this one fact.

**Updated 2026-07-14:** the two security items that made a public push irresponsible
(A1, A2) are now **fixed**. That sharpens the read rather than softening it — the reason
we can't tell anyone about Poold is no longer *"it isn't safe."* It's that **the product
has no way for them to use it.** P0.2 (self-serve creation) is now the whole of P0's
critical path, with P0.5 (Supabase auto-pause) as the remaining infrastructure floor.

---

## 3. Roadmap

### P0 — Make it safe and make it self-serve *(prerequisite for telling anyone about Poold)*

| # | Item | Why | Impact | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | ~~**Fix A1 privilege escalation**~~ ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-07-14 (PR #24)** — `profiles` is column-locked (GRANTs, not RLS — policies can't restrict columns); role changes go through the `admin_set_role()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC | One curious user away from full takeover (all emails, all pools). Blocked everything. | Critical | 🟢 |
| 0.2 | **Self-serve pool creation** — any user can create a pool and becomes its commissioner; per-pool commissioner powers (lock/close/refresh/manage participants for *their* pool); global admin stays for ops | Turns the product from founder-run to commissioner-run. THE strategic unlock — without it there is no growth loop. | Very High | 🔴 (roles model + RLS + admin-UI split into "my pools"; the create wizard itself already exists and mostly just needs un-gating) |
| 0.3 | ~~**A2: move Odds API key server-side**~~ ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-07-14 (PR #24)** — `odds-proxy` edge function; key is now a Supabase secret. ⚠️ **The rotation is a manual deploy step** — the old key was public in the bundle and must be assumed burned | Key was in the public JS bundle; anyone could burn our quota. Pre-marketing gate. | High (risk removal) | 🟢 |
| 0.4 | **Error states instead of blank screens** (C1, C2, B2) | A commissioner's first bad experience shouldn't look like a broken product. Silent failures are trust killers for exactly the audience we can't afford to lose. | High | 🟡 (thread errors through `lib/golf.js` + a few UI states) |
| 0.5 | **Stop Supabase auto-pausing the project** — upgrade to Pro (~$25/mo), or run a year-round heartbeat so the DB never idles out | **Proven failure, 2026-07-13:** the free tier paused after ~7 days idle, Supabase pulled the project's DNS, and getpoold.app died at sign-in with an opaque "load failed." Any gap between tournaments is long enough to trigger it — so an invite that lands in a quiet week reaches a dead app. This is the single cheapest way to stop losing users we've already acquired. | High (risk removal) | 🟢 (Pro is a billing toggle; the heartbeat is a scheduled function) |

### P1 — Sharpen the growth loop *(make every invite and every weekend better)*

| # | Item | Why | Impact | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Invite link preview (OG tags)** — pool name, "You're invited," branded card (H3; includes fixing the "Golf Pick'Em" tab title) | The join link IS the funnel and it currently unfurls as a bare URL in the group chat. Cheapest conversion win available. | High | 🟢 (static OG + title; per-pool dynamic cards are a 🟡 follow-up via a Netlify edge function) |
| 1.2 | **Pick-deadline reminder emails** — "picks lock in 24h and you haven't submitted" | The #1 commissioner pain in every pool is chasing stragglers. Automating the nudge is a retention AND commissioner-love feature. Table stakes at competitors. | High | 🟡 (Supabase scheduled edge function + email; magic-link infra means we already send email) |
| 1.3 | **Live-feel leaderboard** — auto-refetch on interval/focus while an event is in progress, subtle "updated Xm ago" | Users park on this page all weekend; today they must hard-refresh. The product's core moment should feel alive. | Medium-High | 🟢 (client-side refetch of the existing cache; no new infra) |
| 1.4 | **Score-swing / final-result email or share moment** — "You moved to 2nd" or a shareable final-standings card | Brings people back mid-weekend and gives winners something to rub in — trash talk is the product. | Medium | 🟡 |
| 1.5 | **Unmatched-pick flagging (B1) + DQ/DNS handling (B3)** | Scoring integrity is the whole product promise; silent mis-scoring during a live event is a group-chat catastrophe. | Medium | 🟢 |

### P2 — Retention formats *(keep the group alive between Sundays)*

| # | Item | Why | Impact | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **Season / series pools** — one pool spanning multiple events (e.g. all four majors) with aggregate standings | The single biggest format gap vs. every competitor. Converts a one-weekend group into an April-to-July group. Schema hint: `events` is already separate from `pools`; this needs a pool↔many-events link + season standings. | Very High | 🔴 |
| 2.2 | **One & Done format** — season-long, pick one golfer per event, can't reuse | The most popular season format in golf pools (Splash's flagship). Second contest type proves the multi-format seam. | High | 🔴 (new format logic; reuses events/leaderboard infra) |
| 2.3 | **In-pool chat or reactions** — even a lightweight emoji-on-scorecard layer | "Social energy over utility" is a principle; today all trash talk happens off-platform. Start tiny (reactions), not a full chat. | Medium | 🟡 (Supabase realtime exists; scope discipline required) |
| 2.4 | **Pool history / archive** — past pools with final standings, "champion" badges | Gives pools a memory and commissioners bragging-rights continuity. Feeds 2.1. | Medium | 🟢 |
| 2.5 | **Configurable tier format (G1)** | Commissioners of small/large groups need different shapes; currently hardcoded 6×6+2 wildcards. | Medium | 🟡 |

### P3 — Channel + platform expansion *(after golf is demonstrably won)*

| # | Item | Why | Impact | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | **Club/bar onboarding** — a "run your club's Masters pool on Poold" page + white-label-lite (logo/name on the pool) | Majors Challenge charges $599/yr for this; we can land the channel free and monetize later. Needs 0.2 first. | High | 🟡 |
| 3.2 | **PWA / add-to-home-screen** — installable, app icon, offline shell | Mobile-first product with no app-store presence; PWA is 80% of native's value at 5% of cost. | Medium | 🟡 |
| 3.3 | **Multiple pools per event (UI)** — schema already supports it | Lets a bar run a free pool and a stakes pool on the same US Open; also the seam for public "featured event" pools someday. | Medium | 🟡 |
| 3.4 | **Second sport (NFL likely, game-winner/spread, own schema)** | Only after golf retention is proven. The migration made this additive, not a refactor. | High (later) | 🔴 |
| 3.5 | **Monetization decision** — likely: free forever for friends, paid tier for clubs/brands (white-label, custom formats) | Don't charge the commissioner we're trying to acquire; charge the business that uses pools as engagement. Decide only with channel data from 3.1. | — | (decision, not build) |

### Engineering hygiene (running alongside, not a phase)
Phase 5 legacy-table cleanup + `pool_standings` decision (F1) · tests for
`scoring.js`/`tierBuilder.js` (F4) · Nominatim geocoding switch (F3) · a11y pass (E3)
· 404 route (C3). Pull one in whenever a PR is in the neighborhood.

---

## 4. Sequencing logic (why this order)

1. **P0 before any acquisition effort** — a security hole plus founder-gated pool
   creation means marketing would be wasted or dangerous.
2. **P1 before P2** — sharpen the loop for the pools that already happen (majors come
   4× a year; each is a growth event) before building new formats.
3. **2.1 (season pools) is the single most valuable post-P1 build** — it multiplies the
   value of every other retention feature by keeping groups alive between events.
4. **Monetization stays unresolved on purpose** until the club channel produces data.
   Free is a weapon right now; don't sheath it early.

---

## 5. Status log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-10 | Initial roadmap from market research + full repo read. Nothing started; P0 defined as A1 + self-serve creation + A2 + error states. |
| 2026-07-13 | **Shipped: tournament badge color system** (Claude Design import). Badge bg/border are now per-tournament and encode prestige + geography; all 48 events designed and seeded. Not on this roadmap when written — it's craft/polish rather than a P0–P3 item, but it lands squarely on differentiation #1 (the friend-group *feel*), so it earns its place. |
| 2026-07-13 | Supabase free tier **auto-paused the project** after ~7 days idle, taking getpoold.app down with an opaque "load failed" at sign-in. Restored manually. This is a live launch risk, not an annoyance — see the new item **0.5** in P0. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Shipped: P0.1 (A1) + P0.3 (A2)** — PR #24. The self-promotion hole is closed and the Odds key is off the client. Two consequences worth naming. **(1) The blunt read changed:** the blocker on telling anyone about Poold is no longer safety, it's that only the founder can create a pool — P0.2 now *is* the critical path. **(2) A pattern was established, not just a bug fixed:** RLS can't restrict columns, so column access is a GRANT problem, and privileged operations belong in `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs that re-check `is_admin()`. That's now the house rule for every future privileged write (see DECISIONS). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Logged, not shipped: `docs/BRAINSTORM.md`** — a ~120-idea product dump (multi-sport, formats, social, live UI, data, brand, growth, retention, monetization) with an anti-ideas list. It is deliberately **not** a roadmap; it's the pile this roadmap can pull from. Four of its ideas challenge things written here and want an explicit decision: that the second sport should be a *field* sport (F1/UFC — which reuse golf's schema) rather than NFL (which reuses none of it); that a **Crew** object would make season pools (2.1, rated 🔴) mostly a query; that "run it back" is a 🟢 retention win we're leaving on the table; and that the tagline implies a category ("make it interesting") much larger than *sports*. |
| 2026-07-13 | **Shipped: odds coverage fix** (PR #22). Odds were read from one bookmaker and joined to the field by exact name — 11 of 100 players in The Open had no price (incl. Tom Kim, both Højgaards) and silently fell back to OWGR interpolation for tiering. Now unions all books (median price) and matches names in layers. **100/100 priced.** Not a roadmap item, but it was quietly degrading the tier builder — the admin's first real impression of the product — and the diagnosis exposed that we have no test coverage on this path (**F4**). |
